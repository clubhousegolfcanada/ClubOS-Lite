Emergency Procedures & Preparation SOP

(For Remotely Operated, 24/7 Locations)

Table of Contents
1. Welcome & Introduction
2. Company Values & Mission
3. Workplace Policies
4. Code of Conduct
5. Basic HR Info
6. Contacts & Resources

1. Purpose & Scope

Since Clubhouse locations are remotely managed with 24/7 access for customers, this SOP outlines clear steps for handling emergencies from afar. It addresses how to inform and guide customers, coordinate with local services, and ensure brand standards are upheld even without a constant physical staff presence.

2. Key Emergency Contacts & Communication Channels
1. Local Emergency Services (Police, Fire, Ambulance)
- 911 (or local equivalent) remains the primary contact for life-threatening issues (medical, fire, serious crime).
2. Remote Support Team
- Available 24/7 via phone, text, or dedicated messaging app (e.g., Slack, WhatsApp).
- Primary Contact: [Name / Email / 24-hour Phone or Slack handle]
- Backup Contact: [Name / Email / 24-hour Phone or Slack handle]
3. Property / Building Manager
- Responsible for structural or utility issues.
- [Name], [Phone], [Email]
4. Ownership / Executive Contact
- [Name], [Phone], [Email]

Posting Contact Info:
- Each bay or entrance should display a clear sign listing local emergency numbers and the 24/7 remote support phone number.

3. Medical Emergencies (No On-Site Staff)

3.1 Customer Self-Reported Injury
1. Auto-Response / Signage:
- Clear signs instruct customers: “In case of a medical emergency, call 911 immediately. Then notify Clubhouse Remote Support.”
2. Remote Support Procedure:
- If a customer calls or messages about an injury:
1. Advise them to dial 911 immediately if it’s severe.
2. If possible, remain on the line for moral support while they wait for emergency responders.
3. Log the details in the “Incident Tracker” (Section 8).
3. Follow-Up:
- After emergency services have been contacted, coordinate with them for building access if needed (via KISI or remote door controls).
- Document the event, including times, statements, any video footage from security cameras, etc.

3.2 Minor Incidents
1. Customer Contact: If a minor injury occurs (small cut or strain), direct them to first-aid supplies stored on-site (e.g., a simple first-aid kit in each bay or near the entrance).
2. Remote Support Action:
- Encourage them to seek further medical attention if necessary.
- Log the incident for internal records.

4. Facility & Structural Emergencies

4.1 Fire & Evacuation (Unstaffed)
1. Customer Protocol:
- Signage instructs customers to pull the alarm (if available) and call 911.
- They must evacuate immediately using posted exits.
2. Remote Support Procedure:
- If alerted, contact the local fire department for confirmation.
- Remotely unlock all facility doors via KISI (if it’s safe and feasible) to aid evacuation and emergency personnel entry.
- Notify the property manager and ownership.
3. Post-Incident:
- Work with local authorities for any required building checks or repairs.
- Temporarily disable online bookings if the site is unsafe.

4.2 Water Damage / Flooding
1. Customer Notice:
- If a customer reports water on the floor or ceiling leaks, instruct them to leave areas that appear hazardous.
2. Remote Support Procedure:
- Contact the property manager or maintenance for immediate inspection.
- Shut off main water supply remotely if technology allows; otherwise, instruct property manager to do so.
- Disable affected bay(s) in the booking system until repairs are done.

4.3 Power Outage
1. Automated Monitoring:
- Remotely monitored sensors or PCs indicate if power is lost.
2. Remote Support Action:
- Contact the utility company or property manager to confirm outage and repair timeline.
- Update Skedda or booking platform to block out time if the outage is extended.
- Communicate to any upcoming bookings via automated text/email—offer reschedule and refund.

5. Security & Intruder Situations

5.1 Suspicious Activity (Unstaffed Bay)
1. Remote Monitoring:
- Cameras and motion sensors can trigger alerts to remote support.
2. Immediate Steps:
- If you observe suspicious or potentially criminal behavior on camera, call local police.
- Use remote audio or text notifications (if available) to warn intruders.
- Lock or unlock doors as necessary to secure the property, depending on the layout and local laws.
3. Customer Safety:
- If a customer is inside and reports an intruder, advise them to call 911.
- Provide instructions to exit safely if possible.

5.2 Break-Ins or Vandalism
1. Alarm Trigger:
- If an alarm or sensor indicates forced entry, remote support checks camera feeds to confirm.
2. Call Police:
- Immediately notify local law enforcement with location details.
3. Secure Premises:
- Remotely lock doors or disable entry codes if safe to do so (do not trap any persons inside—coordinate with police if the suspect is present).
4. Follow-Up:
- Inform ownership and property manager, gather video evidence, document all details.

6. IT & Technical Failures (Remote Handling)

6.1 System-Wide Booking / Payment Outage
1. Monitoring:
- Remote status dashboards or alerts for booking platform or Stripe downtime.
2. Action:
- Post a banner on the booking website or send an automated text if there’s a known outage.
- Offer customers an alternative booking method ((e.g., phone line (text only)) if the system is down for an extended period.
3. Escalation:
- Contact the booking software provider or Stripe’s support if it’s not a local issue.
- Temporarily block walk-in usage to avoid confusion over payment.

6.2 Hardware Damage (Simulators, Projectors, PCs)
1. Remote Diagnostics:
- Attempt to reboot or run diagnostic scripts if possible.
2. Customer Instructions:
- If a single bay is affected, direct customers to a functioning bay if it’s available.
- If a user is mid-session, offer them an equivalent free session later if the hardware cannot be fixed immediately.
3. Repair Coordination:
- Schedule a service call or arrange shipping replacement parts.
- Mark the affected bay as “Out of Service” in the booking system until resolved.

7. Emergency Preparation & Preventative Measures

7.1 Signage & Supplies
- Emergency Instruction Signs posted at each bay entrance:
- “For medical or fire emergencies, dial 911. Then call our 24/7 support at XXX-XXX-XXXX.”
- First Aid Kits in easy-to-find locations.
- Basic Fire Extinguishers near simulator areas and main exits.

7.2 Regular Equipment Checks
- Weekly Camera Test: Ensure cameras and any motion sensors are streaming and recording properly.
- Monthly Door Access Test: Confirm remote lock/unlock functionality is working.
- Quarterly IT Infrastructure Check: Update PCs, projector firmware, Trackman software, etc.

7.3 Remote Drills & Training
- Simulated Emergencies: The remote support team runs occasional drills (e.g., mock power outage, test alarm triggers) to confirm readiness.
- Documentation Refresh: Revisit emergency SOPs every 6 months, update contacts and procedures as needed.

8. Post-Emergency Follow-Up & Documentation

8.1 Incident Report
- What to Include:
- Date/time, nature of the emergency, any injuries or damage, which parties were contacted, and outcome.
- Attach relevant photos or video clips from camera feeds if available.
- Where to File:
- Maintain an online “Incident Tracker” (e.g., a shared Google Form or ticket system).

8.2 Review & Debrief
1. Team Discussion:
- Within 48 hours, the remote support team and relevant stakeholders meet (virtually) to review the incident’s timeline and handling.
- Identify any process improvements or SOP updates.
2. Customer Follow-Up:
- If a specific customer was impacted, consider a courtesy call or email, possibly offering a free session or future credit if the incident disrupted their game.

8.3 SOP Updates
- Iterate: Modify the relevant SOP sections if new technology or improved workflows become available to reduce risk or better support customers remotely.

Final Notes
- Division of Labor: This SOP covers technology-oriented tasks only—standard facility cleaning and housekeeping are handled separately.
- Reporting: Use Slack or a shared logging system to quickly flag any issues found during checks, so the remote support team or local tech can address them promptly.
- Continuous Improvement: If you find any tasks are redundant or need adjusting to better reflect real usage, update these lists.

By following these procedures, Clubhouse 24/7 Golf maintains a safe, transparent environment that respects the trust customers place in a self-service, tech-enabled facility—even at 2 A.M. without staff physically on-site.

Clubhouse 24/7 Golf: Why We’re Going to Win
Clubhouse isn’t just another golf spot. It’s a system we built from scratch because we were tired of how clunky, overpriced, and inconsistent this industry can be.
We’re not positioning this as a substitute for the course — it’s its own thing. And the way people use it proves there’s room for both.

Clubhouse is Built Different
Booking takes seconds. You show up, click the button Clubhouse texted and emailed you, walk into a clean bay, and start playing. No check-in. No front desk. No confusion. That’s not a gimmick — it’s just well-built tech doing its job
That’s not just convenient — it’s a competitive edge.
And behind it all is a team that’s spent their lives unknowingly learning skills that are needed for this exact moment in time.
- Dylan Runs the systems that keep everything smooth and scalable. IT-focused, efficiency-driven, and set to lead daily operations as we grow.
- Jason handles the IT stack — if it works cleanly and scales fast, it’s him.
- Nick leads every location build start to finish — quicker, cheaper, and more premium than anyone else. Deep contracting background, focus on detail. If it’s not tech, it’s him.
- Mike Shaped the brand, the direction, and the experience from day one. He’s led large teams, trained hundreds, and built deep expertise in customer service, operations, and scaling systems. Now focused on long-term vision — retention, engagement, and a model that scales fast. The team drives it, Mike has the map.

What Makes Clubhouse… Clubhouse

1. The “Never Run Out” Model
We always have tees, balls, free bottled water — the stuff that should be provided but isn’t at other businesses. It’s not easy to stay stocked, but that’s why they don’t. We do.
2. Best Price — Not Cheapest
We’re not racing to the bottom. We offer real value because we find efficiencies and want people to play golf year-round. No raising prices on the weekends or in the busy season. Respect the space and enjoy the benefits. Don’t? Feel free to overpay somewhere else.
3. Not a Hangout. It’s the Clubhouse.
This isn’t a bar with a Trackman. It’s built for tournaments, practice, and serious play. Want to party? You can rent the whole place for cheaper than some charge for one bay.
4. WWRD: What Would Red Bull Do?
We don’t act like a simulator company. We act like an energy brand:
- Free energy drinks during events
- Banners on the wall, not trophies in closets
- When you hear Clubhouse is at an event, it’s going to be an experience.
5. For The People
If something’s off, we fix it. Even if it wasn’t on us. You lose time? We give it back — and then some. Think, “What would no other company do?” Then do more than that.
6. Protect the Experience — Not Policies
No rigid rules or policies. No hidden fine print. If something needs to be fixed, we fix it. If it keeps happening, Jason builds something to catch it next time.
7. Tech-First, Always
We use Trackman. Golf sim specific hardware, overpowered PC’s. Clean everything. If a hitting strip wears down, well, it wont. That’s how we attract the serious golfers.
8. Talk Like a Human
We don’t write like a brand. We write like people. Clear, kind, and if it fits — funny or sarcastic. Think Bob Does Sports, not Titleist.
9. Make the Smart Choice, Even If It Costs More Now
Avoid, at all costs short-term savings that ruin long-term loyalty. We always look at the big picture and strive to be the best Indoor Golf location.

10. Keep Each Clubhouse Consistent & Premium
No small bays to fit an extra one in. No tiered locations. Every bay, every city — same quality, same standard. Experience above all.

Final Word
Clubhouse isn’t a product, and it’s not just a sim rental business. It’s a system built around what we’d want as players — with added details others don’t even think about. And when they try to copy it, it usually makes the gap even more obvious.
When people hear “Clubhouse,” they’ll know it’s going to be clean, it’s going to be smooth, and it’s going to be an experience they remember — because it’s the same every time, at every Clubhouse.
That kind of consistency isn’t easy to build. But we’ve done it — and we’re ready to scale it.

- Go to Daily View in Skedda.
- Click on the customer’s booking and select “View/Edit Details.”
- Change the booking price to $0 and save.

Step 2: Delete the Original Booking
- Exit the edit screen.
- Click the booking again in Day View and choose “Delete.”

Step 3: Create a New Booking
- Create a new booking under the customer’s name.
- Accept the terms and conditions on their behalf.
- Skip the “Number of Golfers” section.

Step 4: Confirm the Booking
- Confirm the new booking.
- Set the price as $0 since no payment changes were made in Stripe.

Changing to a More or Less Expensive Booking
If a customer wants to switch to a booking that is either more or less expensive, follow the standard return process first.

Step 1: Process a Standard Return
- Complete the return using the regular procedure outlined in the “How to Complete a Return” guide.

Step 2: Notify the Customer
After the return is complete, send the following message to the customer:

2. How to Start a Message
Use first names if you have them
Keep greetings short and warm
Examples:
"Hey Chris — sounds good."
"Hi Keri — thanks for sending that over."

3. How to Keep It Clear
Say what you mean right away
Use short sentences
Only explain what’s needed
Examples:
"That’s fixed now. Try again and let me know."
"If not, I’ll look into it once you let me know."

4. Use a Conversational Tone
Talk like a human
Use humor or casual phrases when it fits
Examples:
"Your scores weren’t good enough unfortunately. Joking."
"Whatever works best for you."

5. Be Helpful and Solution-Focused
Always look for a fix
Don’t get lost in the weeds
Examples:
"I’ll handle that and get back to you."
"We can make that work — I’ll send details."

6. Keep Formatting Simple
Use short paragraphs (1–3 sentences)
Use bullets or spacing if listing things

7. When Writing Something Formal
Use clean structure: sections, numbers, headings
Still keep it plain-language, no fluff

Tips to Sound Like Michael
Say "we" instead of "the company"
Use personal pronouns (I, we, you)
Keep the energy helpful, not robotic
Don’t try too hard — real is better than polished

Summary The goal is to sound like a smart, helpful person who knows what they’re doing and actually cares. If it feels natural, clear, and useful — you nailed it.

10. Marketing Strategy & Messaging
Tone: Direct, sharp, anti-corporate. Real talk. No fluff. Never use “vibe.”
Position: Sim golf that actually works. For golfers.
Sample: “No staff. No weird rules. Just walk in and golf.”
Leagues, contests, and sarcastic memes drive brand affinity.

Streamlined Technology Maintenance & Checklists

Guiding Principle

We want to maintain a “no notice” environment for customers, focusing on technology performance. They shouldn’t notice, lag, blurry screens, out of calibration, or missing accessories.  Standard building cleaning (vacuuming floors, emptying trash, etc.) is handled separately by cleaning staff, so it isn’t included here.

1. Daily (Shift) Tech Checklist

Frequency: Once per day or once per shift (depending on usage).
1. Simulator Software Check
- Restart PC and Launch the simulator program (e.g., Trackman) to confirm it loads without errors.
- Quickly verify it can load into the practice range, and then return to the main screen.
2. Visual Inspection (Tech Focus)
- Look for major projector misalignment (e.g., if the image is significantly off-center or very blurry).
- Confirm the hitting mat is not noticeably work (e.g., no indent in the middle, no turf pulling up around the edges).
3. System Health Snapshot
- Ensure each PC is powered on and not displaying critical error messages.
- Check for any cables visibly disconnected or pinched in doors or hardware—reseat if necessary.
4. Displays & Audio
- Confirm any TVs or signage used for promotions or scoreboard are powered on and displaying correct content.
- Test audio level in the simulator bay and location to ensure it’s functioning (not muted or blaring static).
5. Immediate Follow-Up
- If you spot an issue (e.g., software glitch, partial projector failure), log it in Slack or your ticket system for prompt resolution.

2. Weekly Tech Checklist

Frequency: Once a week (preferably on a low-traffic day).
1. Simulator & Software Updates
- Check if your simulator software (Trackman) has pending updates; schedule or install if needed.
- Do a full reset on the trackman io (hold green power for 8 seconds with grip of a golf club. Be careful not to push too hard and misalign the Trackman)
2. Projector Alignment & Focus
- Briefly confirm the projector image is still sharp and aligned. Minor adjustments if image drift occurred.
3. Network Verification
- Confirm the location’s internet connection has no outage alerts. (No need for a detailed speed test—just ensure stable connectivity to the simulator PC.)
4. PC & Peripheral Review
- Check disk space on each PC, ensuring no major drive capacity issues.
- Verify keyboards/mice remain responsive and aren’t running out of battery (if wireless).
5. Light Dusting (Tech Only)
- If projector vents or PC vents are visibly dusty, do a light dusting (compressed air or cloth), focusing on technology components only.
6. Minor Issues Logging
- Note any slightly worn hitting mats or screen/projector issues for the monthly check.

3. Monthly Tech Checklist

Frequency: Once a month (align with other monthly tasks).
1. System & OS Updates
- Install any Windows (or relevant OS) updates. Reboot PCs afterward during off-hours if possible.
2. Projector & Display Maintenance
- Clean projector lens only if you notice dust or a drop in clarity. Use a microfiber cloth or compressed air as recommended by the manufacturer.
- Quickly confirm color/brightness looks consistent across all bays.
3. Hardware & Cabling
- Inspect essential cables (PC-to-projector, sensor cables) for wear or loose connections. Reseat or replace if necessary.
4. Sensor & Calibration Check
- If the simulator software offers a calibration or advanced setup test, run it to confirm everything’s accurate.
5. Security / Remote Access
- Confirm door access systems (KISI) and security camera feeds (if applicable) show no recurring errors.
6. Summary & Next Steps
- Compile short notes on any upcoming replacement needs or persistent minor issues.

4. Quarterly Tech Checklist

Frequency: Every 3 months (4x a year).
1. Deeper Maintenance
- Projector Filters (if applicable): Clean or replace filters if recommended by the manufacturer.
- PC Interiors: Lightly blow out dust using compressed air (only if comfortable handling PC components).
2. Firmware & Driver Updates
- Check if any projectors, GPUs, or other hardware have recommended (stable) firmware updates.
- Update only if needed, to avoid unnecessary risk on well-functioning systems.
3. Full Simulator Calibration
- Perform a more detailed calibration routine or advanced diagnostic within Trackman or your sim software.
- Confirm sensor alignment, especially if you’ve noticed data discrepancies.
4. Network & Bandwidth
- Quick check that your internet speed is still meeting location needs—particularly if usage has grown or new services were added.
5. Condition Assessment
- Evaluate the state of hitting mats, screens, and major hardware for end-of-life or near-end-of-life signs. Note these for the annual plan.

5. Yearly (Annual) Review & Replacement Planning

Frequency: Once a year—often during a slow season or at fiscal year-end.
1. Equipment Upgrade Audit
- Projectors: Assess brightness, color performance—decide if a new lamp or upgrade is needed.
- PCs: Evaluate CPU/GPU performance; plan replacements if they no longer meet new software requirements.
2. Budget & ROI Analysis
- Compare upgrade costs with potential benefits (better visuals, less downtime, improved customer satisfaction).
- Prioritize which upgrades will have the biggest impact on the “no notice” experience.
3. Bulk Maintenance Scheduling
- If multiple items (e.g., screens, mats, projectors) need replacement, coordinate a short facility downtime or staged approach to minimize disruptions.
4. SOP & Tech Roadmap Update
- Document any changes to hardware, or new processes learned over the year.
- Adjust the upcoming year’s maintenance schedule based on real-world usage and any known vendor updates.

By following this streamlined approach, Clubhouse 24/7 Golf ensures the simulators, projectors, PCs, and network infrastructure remain Best in class.

Welcome!

We’re excited to have you on board. Clubhouse 24/7 Golf is all about delivering a premium, tech-first indoor golf experience that’s friendly, efficient, and always putting the player first. This short guide outlines who we are, what sets us apart, and why it matters.

1. Who We Are & Why We Exist
1. Our Origin
We started Clubhouse 24/7 Golf to solve the problems we saw in other indoor golf businesses: clunky booking, hidden fees, and inconsistent quality. Our goal was (and still is) to build a system that’s painless for the golfer and profitable for everyone involved—without cutting corners on the experience.
2. Our Core Difference
- Tech-Centric: Seamless online booking, easy check-in, advanced simulator hardware (Trackman and top-tier PCs).
- No Hidden Policies: If something goes wrong, we fix it—no hoops, no hassle.
- Best Price—Not the Cheapest: We keep year-round rates fair. We won’t nickel-and-dime; we’d rather earn loyalty.

3. Always Stocked
Balls, tees, water—things that should be standard but many places overlook. We believe you shouldn’t have to worry about basics when you come to play.

[Insert Image Placeholder: A Simple Flowchart or Photo Depicting “Click → Enter → Play” Booking Process]

2. Key Values & Goals

2.1 Key Values
- Protect the Experience, Not Policies
We’d rather do right by the customer than enforce rigid rules. If a guest needs a last-minute change, we’ll figure it out.
- Talk Like a Human
We’re direct, friendly, and avoid “corporate speak.” It’s more genuine—and that’s what people appreciate.
- Technology First
We invest in top-tier equipment and software, whether it’s the Trackman system or a streamlined booking platform. Customers shouldn’t battle outdated tech to have fun.

2.2 Goals for the Year
1. Expand Locations
We’re growing regionally while keeping every location consistent in quality and experience.
2. Enhance Tournaments & Events
Tournaments bring the community together and keep things competitive. Expect more interactive and data-driven competitions.
3. Refine Membership & Loyalty
We want long-term engagement—meaning more perks, better tracking of player performance, and smoother ways to reward repeat visits.

3. What Sets Clubhouse Apart
1. Never Run Out
We commit to always having the essentials in stock. Customers shouldn’t have to scrounge for tees or chase staff for water.
2. Respect in Pricing
We keep it fair all year—no weekend markups or “peak season” exploits. Golfers deserve consistent access, so we never penalize them for playing more.

3. WWRD (What Would Red Bull Do?)
We’re aiming to be more than just a simulator bay. We bring energy, excitement, and out-of-the-box ideas to stand out from the usual “sim shop.”
4. Quality Above All
Every location has the same high standard—no second-tier gear or neglected corners. If it wears down, we fix or replace it right away.

4. Getting Started as a Team Member
1. Brand Voice
- Keep it straightforward: Whether talking with customers, posting on social, or sending emails, be clear and real.
2. Customer Focus
- If something’s off, prioritize making it right. We’d rather lose a little revenue than a good relationship.
3. Continuous Improvement
- We’re always open to ideas—new tournaments, tech upgrades, or marketing concepts. Speak up if you see a way to innovate.

Onboarding Program for Senior Roles at Clubhouse 24/7 Golf

1. Pre-Arrival: Strategic Alignment

Purpose: Ensure new team members at a senior level understand our core philosophy, market positioning, and big-picture vision—so they can start making an impact from day one.
1. Core Principles & Ethos (Summary)
- Customer-First Mindset: Our business thrives on addressing customer needs quickly and generously, even when it’s not our fault. This approach is a core differentiator in an industry often defined by rigid rules.
- Technology as a Competitive Advantage: We emphasize seamless booking, advanced analytics, and top-tier simulator equipment. Senior hires, particularly those with an IT or operational background, will be instrumental in refining and scaling these systems.
- Consistency of Experience: Each location delivers the same premium feel—no “flagship” versus “budget” sites.
2. Business & Ownership Overview
- Leadership Structure: A quick overview of the founding team—how responsibilities are split, who leads technical innovation, who manages site builds, and who steers the brand direction.
- Growth Strategy: We’re expanding in a measured but ambitious way. Senior roles have a direct hand in streamlining new site launches, optimizing existing sites, and shaping a long-term roadmap.
3. Role-Specific Context
- Managerial Focus: Supervising multiple Clubhouse locations, overseeing revenue performance, staff coordination, and monthly operational reviews.
- IT & Technical Leadership: Building robust, automated solutions for booking, billing, membership, and event management—plus integrating hardware (like Trackman) with software tools for a frictionless user experience.
- Business & Financial Oversight: Monitoring expenses vs. revenues across locations, leading negotiations with vendors or partners, and refining pricing strategies to maintain that “best value” position.

2. Early Immersion: Culture & Operations

2.1 Culture & Brand
1. High-Level Brand Strategy
- We’re not just a typical simulator center. Our brand is an “experience brand” for serious golfers. That means tournaments, promotions, content, and tech innovation are always top priorities.
2. Customer Interaction Philosophy
- Everything from how we handle refunds to how we communicate on social media reflects our brand voice: candid, authentic, and approachable. As a senior member, you’ll model this approach for the broader team.
3. Decision-Making Autonomy
- Senior hires have the latitude to make customer-centric decisions—like issuing refunds or offering creative solutions—without layers of approval, as long as these decisions align with our guiding principles.

2.2 Core Procedures & Systems (High-Level Mastery)
1. Booking & Scheduling Fundamentals
- Our proprietary or chosen booking system handles deposits, time-based reservations, and location-specific availability. Familiarity with its architecture lets you optimize how we handle peak/off-peak pricing, multi-location management, and special promo codes.
2. Refund & Return Process
- We maintain a straightforward method for processing cancellations and refunds. For a senior leader, the focus is on identifying patterns (e.g., recurring late cancellations, frequent re-scheduling) and shaping policies that still keep the process fair and hassle-free.
3. Change Management for Bookings
- Changing a booking is more than just shifting a time slot. It triggers a new confirmation, a deposit check, and sometimes an adjustment in user data. You’ll be setting or reviewing the rules that minimize friction for customers while maintaining accurate financial tracking.
4. Monthly & Quarterly Operational Checkpoints
- At the start of each month, we do a thorough review of tournaments, marketing updates, subscription services, system updates, and location-specific performance. As a senior member, you’ll take the lead in reviewing results, spotting inefficiencies, and making data-driven improvements.

3. Advanced Tools & Technology Briefing

3.1 Booking Platform & Data Analysis
- System Architecture: Dive into how the booking platform integrates with payment processing, membership tagging, and real-time availability across multiple locations.
- Data Utilization: Explore how we use booking history, membership data, or event participation metrics to influence marketing and operational decisions.

3.2 Payment & Financial Tracking
- Integrations with Payment Gateways: For large-scale or multi-location expansions, you’ll manage how we track revenue, process refunds efficiently, and maintain consistent accounting practices.
- Fraud Prevention & Chargebacks: Oversee the checks and balances that keep transaction disputes low and build trust with loyal customers.

3.3 Simulator Infrastructure
- Trackman & Associated Hardware: While day-to-day calibration might be someone else’s responsibility, senior IT or managers are responsible for ensuring location setups remain consistent, downtime is minimal, and new upgrades are integrated seamlessly.
- Remote Monitoring & Maintenance: Explore our approach to monitoring system health (software updates, sensor checks, bandwidth usage) and scheduling maintenance without disrupting prime booking hours.

3.4 Communication & CRM Systems
- Email & SMS Templates: High-level management of customer communication flows. You’ll refine these templates for tone, clarity, and brand alignment.
- Customer Profile Insights: We record notes on client preferences or issues. Senior roles may propose expansions to these CRM features—for instance, loyalty tracking, advanced segmentation, or event invitations based on player stats.

4. Hands-On Integration & Leadership

4.1 Shadow Key Processes
1. Observe an End-to-End Refund or Booking Modification
- Understand the full cycle: from the moment a guest requests a change to how that data is logged for financial or marketing review.
2. Review a Monthly Operations Meeting
- See how location revenue and membership growth are presented, where the primary bottlenecks are, and what solutions are currently in play.

4.2 System Audits & Improvement Planning
- Identify Immediate Wins: After your initial observations, note what can be quickly improved—like better user tagging or adjusting how we structure monthly tournament promos.
- Longer-Term Projects: Align with leadership on major initiatives (e.g., a new location launch or a major software upgrade) and plan your involvement.

5. Tournaments, Events, & Community Engagement

5.1 Competitive Events & Seasonal Leagues
- Structure & Timeline: We often host multi-round, knockout-style events with significant reach. As a senior manager or IT lead, you’ll influence how we coordinate scoring, broadcast final matches, and handle prize distribution.
- Marketing & Sponsorship: Tournaments frequently attract sponsors. You may be involved in forging or maintaining these partnerships, negotiating terms, or scaling the event to multiple locations.

5.2 Community Outreach
- Open Houses & Themed Nights: We do special events—like glow-in-the-dark golf sessions or casual intro classes. High-level roles may coordinate event staff, tech requirements, or promotional campaigns to drive participation.
- Membership Retention Strategies: Identify top players or frequent visitors, offer them exclusive benefits, and track the ROI of these loyalty initiatives.

6. Ongoing Growth & Development

6.1 Strategic Reviews & Check-Ins
- Bi-Weekly or Monthly Reviews: A chance to align on location performance, upcoming marketing pushes, and any operational concerns that need executive input.
- Quarterly Insight Reports: Larger-scale review of revenue vs. expenses, membership growth, system reliability, and new feature performance.

6.2 Innovation & Scalability
- Proposing New Features or Processes: High-level team members are encouraged to champion new ideas—whether it’s a software integration, an AI-driven booking assistant, or a fresh approach to tournaments.
- Identifying Industry Trends: Stay updated on emerging simulator technologies, new marketing avenues, or innovative membership models. Present these opportunities to the leadership team to keep Clubhouse at the forefront.

7. Milestones & Advancement
1. 30-Day In-Depth Assessment
- By your first month, you’ll be expected to have a comprehensive grasp of our booking platform, financial tracking, and location performance metrics. You should also be formulating initial recommendations or quick wins.
2. 60-Day Operational Leadership
- Take ownership of core responsibilities—like hosting a monthly review call, optimizing daily IT support routines, or leading advanced staff trainings.
3. 90-Day Strategic Impact
- At this stage, you’ll be fully integrated, driving larger initiatives—such as expansions, advanced tech rollouts, or high-profile events. You’ll also be mentoring others and shaping the long-term vision.
